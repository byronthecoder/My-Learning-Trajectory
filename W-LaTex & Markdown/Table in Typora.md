## Table in Typora

To create a table in Typora, you could simplify write down a table header in markdown.

```
|First Header | Second Header|

```

And then press `Return` key.

Also, you could also insert table from menubar.

A table must have table headers and at least one row and one column.

## Add Row in Table

Press `Command/Ctrl+Enter` to quickly insert an empty row under current table row. Context menu is also available for add row action.

## Delete Row in Table

The delete line command (`Shift+Command/Ctrl+L`) will delete current table row in a table. Context menu is also available for delete row action.

## Add/Delete Column in Table

Right click on a table cell, and in submenu of `table` in context menu, thereâ€™s menu items for add/remove table columns.

If you have a Mackbook with **touchbar**, you could also use buttons from touchbar for add/move/delete table row/column.

## Resize Table

Put the cursor inside a table and a table tooltip will show above the table header. Click the most left icon, and you will be able to resize the table like most rich editors.

If you want to make the table larger than 6 columns or 10 rows, you could click the row/column number input and input a proper number.

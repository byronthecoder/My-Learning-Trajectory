# The Operating System

------

## two essentially unrelated functions:

- Manage the hardware resources form misuse by runaway applications
- Provide application programs with sample and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices.

## Background:

The architecture (instruction set, memory organization, I/O, and bus structure) of most computers at the machine-language level is primitive and awkward to program.

## containï¼š

Operating systems contain many drives for controlling I/O devices, and a disk driver.

## Different kinds of system:

Uniprocessor system: (in the early 1960s)

- contain a single processor.
- Only execute the code for a single process, but can Switch among multiple tasks.

Multiprocessor system: (since 1980s)

- Consist of multiple processors all under the control of a single operating system kernel.
- It is becoming prevalent with the advent of Multi-core processors and hyperthreading.

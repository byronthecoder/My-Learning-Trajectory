# A First Course in Probability
## Axioms of Probability
The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the ___sample space___ of the experiment, denoted by $S$.
Any subset $E$ of the sample space is known as an ___event___.
If $E_2, E_2, ...$ are events.
	The ___union___ of these events, denoted by $\union_{n=1f}^\fini E_n$, is defined to be that event which consists of all outcomes that are in $E_n$ for at least one value of $n=1, 2, ...$.
	The ___intersection___ of the events $E_n$, denoted by $\intersection _{n=1}^\finit E_n$, is defined to be the event consisting of those outcomes which are in all of the events $E_n$, n=1, 2, ...$.
The ___conplement___ of $E$,denoted by $E^c$, consists of all outcomes in the sample space $S$ that are not in $E$.
- $E^c$ occurs iff $E$ does not occur.
- $S^c = 0$
